# Use rsync to bring all files from local to the remote
#
# Flags:
#  -a Archive mode: It combines the -rlptgoD options together.  This handles recursive traversal and preserving
#       symlinks, file modification times, and permissions.
#  -r Recursive (note, I found a trick where you need to postfix the source with a dot "." to get this to work properly)
#  -b Backs up the files on the destination when there are conflicts (Don't do this this is super annoying)
#  -d Deletes files that are not recognized
#  -u Ignore files on the destination that are newer (this is enabled on the source->dest, not the other way around!)
#  -v Verbose
